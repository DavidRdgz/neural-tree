# neural-tree

neural-tree is an implementation of the algorithm developed in the paper [Neural Trees: Using Neural Nets in a Tree Classifier Structure](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=150832&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D150832). 

The abstract to the paper by Stromberg, et al. gives a nice introduction to neural trees.

>The concept of tree classifiers is combined with the popular neural net structure. Instead of having one large neural net to capture all the regions in the feature space, the authors suggest the compromise of using small single-output nets at each tree node. This hybrid classifier is referred to as a neural tree.

# Quick Start

Currently there are some package dependencies. These include:



Simply load the neural-tree files into your working directory. Then simply run one of the functions in the samples file.
